## High-Yield Savings Accounts

A high-yield savings account (HYSA) is a deposit account that earns a higher annual percentage yield (APY) than a standard savings account at a traditional bank. HYSAs are an ideal place to store your emergency fund and other cash reserves you may need in the short-term.

### What is APY?

APY stands for annual percentage yield, which shows the real rate of return earned on an account over one year when compounding periods are taken into account. The higher the APY, the more interest you earn on your deposited funds.

### Benefits of a High-Yield Account

The primary advantage of a HYSA over a regular savings account is the higher interest rate earned on your cash balance. While typical bank accounts might earn 0.01% APY, the best HYSAs pay 3-4% or more currently.

On a $10,000 balance for example, earning 0.01% APY amounts to just $1 in interest over a year. But at a 4% APY, you'd earn $400 on that same $10,000 balance. This higher return helps your cash grow faster for goals like an emergency fund.

Other potential benefits include:

- FDIC insured up to $250,000 per depositor
- Online access with easy fund transfers
- No minimum balance requirements often
- More liquidity than other short-term investments

### Opening a HYSA

Most online banks like Ally, Marcus, Vio, and others offer HYSA products that consistently pay higher yields than brick-and-mortar banks. It's easy to open an account online and link to your existing checking account for transfers.

### Best Uses for a HYSA

A HYSA is an ideal place to store funds you want to keep liquid and low-risk, like an emergency fund with 3-6 months' expenses. Other uses include saving for short-term goals like a down payment on a home or car. The higher APY allows your money to grow more quickly than in a traditional savings account.

By earning a reasonable return while keeping your cash safe and accessible, a high-yield savings account is a smart cash management solution for low-risk savings.
