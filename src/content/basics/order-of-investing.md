## Order of Investing

When it comes to saving and investing your money, the order in which you prioritize different accounts and goals is crucial. Following a smart order of investing allows you to maximize returns, take advantage of tax benefits, and ensure you are covering essential bases first.

### Why Order Matters

The money you have available to save and invest is limited, so it's important to put those dollars in the right places first. Investing in the optimal order allows you to capture free money from employers, build a safety net, reduce money-draining debt, and take full advantage of tax-advantaged accounts. It's a strategic approach to make the most of every dollar.

1. Capture the Full Employer 401(k) Match

   If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contributing enough to capture the full match should be your top priority. A common match is 50% of your contributions up to 6% of your salary. So if you earn $60,000 per year, your employer would deposit $1,800 into your 401(k) for free, just for contributing $3,600 yourself. It's an automatic 100% return on the first half of your investment from day one!

1. Pay Down High-Interest Debt

   Before investing extra money, it usually makes sense to pay down any high-interest debt from credit cards, personal loans, etc. Debts with interest rates above 6-8% act as a constant drain on your wealth. Paying those off is like earning a risk-free return equivalent to the interest rate.

1. Build an Emergency Fund

   An emergency fund acts as a buffer to prevent you from going into debt when unexpected expenses pop up. Aim to set aside 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in a high-yield savings account. This cash reserve protects your other investments from needing to be tapped prematurely.

1. Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Retirement Accounts

   Once your employer match is captured, aggressively fund tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs up to the annual limits. A Roth IRA may be preferable for its tax-free withdrawals in retirement, versus traditional pre-tax accounts.

1. Invest in a Taxable Brokerage Account

   If you have additional funds after maxing retirement accounts, open a taxable brokerage account to invest for other longterm goals like buying a home or earning income in retirement. Be mindful of asset location and tax efficiency.

1. Contribute to College Savings (529s)

   For parents saving for education expenses, tax-advantaged 529 accounts may be suitable after funding retirement and taxable accounts. Contributions are after-tax but growth is tax-deferred.

1. Pay Down Low-Interest Debt

   After securing your financial bases, tackle lower-interest debt obligations like mortgages or student loans more aggressively.

1. Invest in Other Assets

   With all the core bases covered, you can look into other investment opportunities like real estate, small businesses, alternative assets, etc. The key is following this order rather than simultaneously spreading limited funds around.
   Sticking to this order of investing ensures you never miss out on free money, allows you to build a solid financial foundation, takes full advantage of tax-advantaged vehicles, and protects you from accumulating excessive debt. It's a strategic pathway to build lasting wealth!
